read pdb file

convert pdb file to connect list

create a graph from this connect list

calc directly from graph :
- edge count
- vertices count
- dist matrix
- degree of each node
- sorted degrees
- edge list


degree_edge_list from degree and edge_list
m_plus from degree_edge_list
m_minus from degree_edge_list
m_mul from degree_edge_list
m_square_plus from degree_edge_list

all_operations_colA(m_plus to m_sq_plus) -> colAvalues, col
